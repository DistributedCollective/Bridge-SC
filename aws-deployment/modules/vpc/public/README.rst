===============================
MODULE: VPC with Public Subnets
===============================

General
=======

Based on Isolated VPC module.

This module creates a basic VPC with public subnets in each availability zone, an Internet
Gateway, and a "public" route table with default route through the Internet Gateway.

As there are many possible network layouts, no private subnets are created by default, use
``vpc/subnets`` module to add them.

Parameters
==========

``name``
  Base name for the VPC and sub-resources, must be in the "Project-ENV" format. Resource names are
  generated by appending individual identifiers to this - e.g., "Project-ENV-VPC" or
  "Project-ENV-Public-SUBNET-a".

``cidr``
  IPv4 CIDR prefix to associate with the VPC. NB: Though VPC supports more than one range - this
  feature is too rarely used and is not covered by the module.

``public_zones``
  Availability zones names to cover with public subnets. A good default is ``local.zone_names``.

``public_bits``, ``public_base``
  Public subnets prefix width and base number - see Terraform's ``cidrsubnet()`` function docs for
  details.

``tags``, ``vpc_tags``, ``public_tags``
  Extra tags for the resources. "Name" and "Tier" tags are appended to this map.


Outputs
=======

``id``, ``name``
  ID (suitable for "vpc_id" parameter) and name of the VPC

``rt_default``, ``rt_public``
  Default and Public VPC route tables, respectively.

``public_subnets``
  A map of public subnets as a list (``public_subnets.ids``) and them as a map with AZ name as a
  key (``public_subnets.azs``).


Example
=======

Can be used as follows::

  ### VPC: MGMT
  module "vpc" {
    source = "../../modules/vpc/public/"

    name = local.basename
    cidr = var.vpc_cidr

    public_zones = local.zone_names
    public_bits  = 8
    public_base  = 0

    tags        = local.base_tags
    vpc_tags    = { "kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.eks_cluster}" = "shared" }
    public_tags = { "kubernetes.io/role/elb" = "1" }
  }
